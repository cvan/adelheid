An interactive photocentric storybook.

The book consists of chapters. A chapter contains:

- title + text
- key image
- audio
- moments
- images

Adelheid is generated by a static page generator,
[wok](http://wok.mythmon.com).

- ```pip install wok```
- ```wok```

Chapters are defined in ```content/chapter/``` as Markdown files where the
title, text, and key image is specified. We also define a slug, or codename,
for the chapter so we can connect it with moments and images. Chapter audio
is set via the ```song``` YAML attribute pointing to the path of the audio
file.

Moments for a chapter are defined in
```content/chapter/moments/CHAPTER_SLUG/``` as Markdown files where the
```tag``` attribute in the YAML header is set to the slug of the chapter it
will be connected to. Moments also contain a title, text, and key image.

Images for a chapter are placed in ```media/img/chapters/CHAPTER_SLUG/```. They
will automatically be detected in placed in the chapter's image reel.
